# ICS Dissertation Code

**Semi-analytical modeling of inverse-Compton scattering spectra using Python**

This repository contains the full codebase developed as part of an M.Sc. Physics (Astrophysics specialization) dissertation. The project models inverse-Compton scattering (ICS) spectra using semi-analytical expressions in the Thomson regime, focusing on both thermal (blackbody) and non-thermal (power-law) photon seed fields.

## 📊 Example Output

The demo notebook (`main.ipynb`) produces a sample ICS SED for:
- \( \alpha = 2.0 \)
- \( \gamma_{\min} = 10^2 \), \( \gamma_{\max} = 10^5 \)
- Planck photon field at \( T = 2.72 \,\mathrm{K} \)

---

## 🧪 Validation

- Emissivity scaling \( \epsilon_s \sim \gamma^2 \epsilon \) confirmed
- Compared against Blumenthal & Gould (1970)
